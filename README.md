# wordle helper extension

A small extension for Chrome written in JavaScript.

Searches through mutliple dictionaries and displays remaining possible words while playing [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

Broken as of 12/2023 due to the game migrating to nytimes.com - I'll fix this as soon as I'll find the time.
